# Prophet ﷺ did not pass away on 12th Rabiul Awwal

The Muslim world has unanimously agreed on this point that after the Book of Allah , the best book this Ummah has is Sahih Bukhari.

This great collection of hadith was narrated by the great Imam Muhammad bin Ismail Bukhari رَحِمَه ٱللَّٰهُ, after about 270 years after Prophet's ﷺ noble soul passed away, he compiled one hundred thousand authentic hadith ,totalling upto 7275.


The **mainstream scholars of the Ummah** and the horologists agree that Rasoolullah ﷺ moved from Makkah to Madina and in during his last Hajj in the tenth year of Hijrah He delivered his last famous Khutba on the day of **Friday**, which is popularly known as _Khutbat-ul-Wida._

During this time the verses related to the completion of religion were also revealed. And then in this last Hajj _[Immediately after in the next year in Safar or Rabi'ul Abwal (because there exists Mutallik Ikhtalaf from the month)_

It is argued that it was Monday , when Rasoolullah ﷺ passed away. In the year of 44 AH on the 12nd day of Rabiul Awwal.

_[We Will explain that 12 Rabi'ul Awwal was NOT the day when our beloved Prophet ﷺ passed away !]_

Let us first of all examine these historical facts in the light of 2 famous hadith recorded by Bukhari 

**_Number 1_** : 
	
	 9th Dhul Hijjah i.e. on the 9th day (Day of Arafah) was the day of Friday.

**_Number 2_** : 
	
	 Rasoolullah ﷺ was passed away on Monday

Note: There is no difference of opinion about Rasoolullah ﷺ performing the last Hajj in 10 AH and being passing away in 11 AH

**Hadith 1** : _Umar ibn al-Khattab reported: A man from the Jews said, “O leader of the believers, there is a verse you recite in your book and, had it been revealed to us as Jews, we would have taken that day as a celebration.” Umar said, “Which verse is it?” The man recited the verse, “Today I have completed your religion for you, perfected My favor upon you, and have chosen Islam as your religion.” (5:3)_

_Umar said, “I know the day and place in which this verse was revealed to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. It was while he was standing on the day of Arafat on Friday.”_

Narrated Anas bin Malik:

**Hadith 2** : _While Abu Bakr was leading the people in the morning prayer on a Monday, the Prophet came towards them suddenly having lifted the curtain of 'Aisha's house, and looked at them as they were standing in rows and smiled. Abu Bakr tried to come back thinking that Allah's Apostle wanted to come out for the prayer. The attention of the Muslims was diverted from the prayer because they were delighted to see the Prophet. The Prophet waved his hand to them to complete their prayer, then he went back into the room and let down the curtain. The Prophet expired on that very day._

### Approach
We have used **propositional Logic** to connect the different combination of dates spread across 4 months from Dhul-Hijja of 10 AH to Rabiul Awwal of 11 AH.
In logic, a logical connective (also called a logical operator, sentential connective, or sentential operator) is a logical constant. They can be used to connect logical formulas.


### Proofs
Analyzing dates from 9 Dhul Hijjah of 10 AH (Friday) to 12 Rabi ul Awwal that include 4 months the below table shows all permutations of dates :
