# Prophet ﷺ did not pass away on 12th Rabiul Awwal

The Muslim world has unanimously agreed on this point that after the Book of Allah , the best book this Ummah has is Sahih Bukhari.

This great collection of hadith was narrated by the great Imam Muhammad bin Ismail Bukhari رَحِمَه ٱللَّٰهُ, after about 270 years after Prophet's ﷺ noble soul passed away, he compiled one hundred thousand authentic hadith ,totalling upto 7275.


The mainstream scholars of the Ummah and the horologists agree that Rasoolullah ﷺ moved from Makkah to Madina and in during his last Hajj in the tenth year of Hijrah He delivered his last famous Khutba on the day of Friday, which is popularly known as Khutbatul Vida.

During this time the verses related to the completion of religion were also revealed. And then in this last Hajj [Immediately after in the next year in Safar or Rabi'ul Abwal (because there exists Mutallik Ikhtalaf from the month)

It is argued that it was Monday , when Rasoolullah ﷺ passed away. In the year of 44 AH on the 12nd day of Rabiul Awwal.

[We Will explain that 12 Rabi'ul Abbal Rasoolullah ﷺ was NOT the day of death of the Prophet ﷺ |

Let us first of all examine these historical facts in the light of 2 famous hadith recorded by Bukhari 

Number 1: 9th Dhul Hijjah i.e. on the 9th day (Day of Arafah) was the day of Friday.

Number 2: Rasoolullah ﷺ was passed away on Monday

Note: There is no difference of opinion about Rasoolullah ﷺ performing the last Hajj in 10 AH and being passing away in 11 AH

Hadith 1 : Umar ibn al-Khattab reported: A man from the Jews said, “O leader of the believers, there is a verse you recite in your book and, had it been revealed to us as Jews, we would have taken that day as a celebration.” Umar said, “Which verse is it?” The man recited the verse, “Today I have completed your religion for you, perfected My favor upon you, and have chosen Islam as your religion.” (5:3)

Umar said, “I know the day and place in which this verse was revealed to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. It was while he was standing on the day of Arafat on Friday.”

Narrated Anas bin Malik:

Hadith 2 : While Abu Bakr was leading the people in the morning prayer on a Monday, the Prophet came towards them suddenly having lifted the curtain of 'Aisha's house, and looked at them as they were standing in rows and smiled. Abu Bakr tried to come back thinking that Allah's Apostle wanted to come out for the prayer. The attention of the Muslims was diverted from the prayer because they were delighted to see the Prophet. The Prophet waved his hand to them to complete their prayer, then he went back into the room and let down the curtain. The Prophet expired on that very day.
